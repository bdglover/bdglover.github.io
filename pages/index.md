# Roberts Settlement
Just north of Indianapolis in Jackson Township, Hamilton County, Indiana, stand the remains of an African-American pioneer farm settlement. It was founded in 1835 by free blacks of mixed racial heritage who migrated mostly from North Carolina and Virginia to escape deteriorating racial conditions in the South.  The majority of pioneers had the Roberts surname, but other families such as the Waldens, Winburns, Rices and Gilliams also made this migration over a period of 20 to 30 years in the mid-1800s. Their goals were the pursuit of economic, educational and religious aspirations with greater freedom and fewer racial barriers. These goals were achieved through considerable hard work and the assistance of friendly and racially tolerant white neighbors of the Quaker and Wesleyan faiths living in the surrounding area. We present our shared histories through stories and artifact as part of the Roberts Settlement Digital Archive.
